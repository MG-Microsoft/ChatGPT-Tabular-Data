# Use ChatGPT to Chat and Query Tabular/SQL Data

## installation
To get started, beore runing the notebook in this repo, install LangChain with the following command:

pip install langchain
pip install openai

## Environment Setup

Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, apis, etc.

For this example, we will be using OpenAIâ€™s APIs, so we will first need to install their SDK:

pip install openai

We will then need to set the environment variable in the terminal.

export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

Alternatively, you could do this from inside the Jupyter notebook (or Python script):

import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
